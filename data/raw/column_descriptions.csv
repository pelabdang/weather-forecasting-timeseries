column,description
date,Date and time of the observation.
p,Atmospheric pressure in millibars (mbar).
T,Air temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
Tpot,"Potential temperature in Kelvin (K), representing the temperature an air parcel would have if moved to a standard pressure level."
Tdew,"Dew point temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), indicating the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture."
rh,"Relative humidity as a percentage (%), showing the amount of moisture in the air relative to the maximum it can hold at that temperature."
VPmax,"Maximum vapor pressure in millibars (mbar), representing the maximum pressure exerted by water vapor at the given temperature."
VPact,"Actual vapor pressure in millibars (mbar), indicating the current water vapor pressure in the air."
VPdef,"Vapor pressure deficit in millibars (mbar), measuring the difference between maximum and actual vapor pressure, used to gauge drying potential."
sh,"Specific humidity in grams per kilogram (g/kg), showing the mass of water vapor per kilogram of air."
H2OC,Concentration of water vapor in millimoles per mole (mmol/mol) of dry air.
rho,"Air density in grams per cubic meter (g/m³), reflecting the mass of air per unit volume."
wv,"Wind speed in meters per second (m/s), measuring the horizontal motion of air."
max. wv,"Maximum wind speed in meters per second (m/s), indicating the highest recorded wind speed over the period."
wd,"Wind direction in degrees (°), representing the direction from which the wind is blowing."
rain,"Total rainfall in millimeters (mm), showing the amount of precipitation over the observation period."
raining,"Duration of rainfall in seconds (s), recording the time for which rain occurred during the observation period."
SWDR,"Short-wave downward radiation in watts per square meter (W/m²), measuring incoming solar radiation."
PAR,"Photosynthetically active radiation in micromoles per square meter per second (µmol/m²/s), indicating the amount of light available for photosynthesis."
max. PAR,Maximum photosynthetically active radiation recorded in the observation period in µmol/m²/s.
Tlog,"Temperature logged in degrees Celsius (°C), potentially from a secondary sensor or logger."
OT,"Likely refers to an operational timestamp or an offset in time, but may need clarification depending on the dataset's context."
